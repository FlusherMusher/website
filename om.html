        <p>there exists a niche thing on youtube called "oscilloscope music", popularized by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@jerobeamfenderson1" target="_blank">jerobeam fenderson</a>.</p>
        <p>what is it? <a href="https://oscilloscopemusic.com/software/oscistudio/" target="_blank">complex math and coding in c++</a>, making good visuals and audio. it seems very difficult, but the results are awesome.</p>
        <p>if your music taste is like mine (so you like electronic), <b>IM BEGGING YOU</b> to check this out. its <b>REALLY, REALLY</b> good.</p>
        <p>recently, after <b>6</b> years, he has released "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDERfRP2GI0" target="_blank">n-spheres</a>". best shit i've listened to in a while. thoughts down below.</p>
        <br>
        <p>to start off, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywdRQ3zU6Uc" target="_blank">function</a>. pretty good! afterwards comes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9jOWIhZZCE" target="_blank">intersect</a>. i liked this one for a bit, but im not really the biggest fan. still good though!</p>
        <p>then came <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uL_CZ1wWnI" target="_blank">attractor</a>. that was my favorite. visuals went crazy, and the fact that the song has no straight lines is cool as shit too.</p>
        <p>then came <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDERfRP2GI0&t=1221s" target="_blank">flux</a>. cant really say much, visuals are good. its name is also similar to mine :p neat stuff.</p>
        <p>and finally, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDERfRP2GI0&t=1557s" target="_blank">core</a>. mind blown. speechless. it starts off pretty calmly, but then comes the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDERfRP2GI0&t=1644s" target="_blank"><b>CRAZIEST SHIT EVER. OH MY GOD.</b></a></p>
        <p>not only does this <b>SLAP REALLY BADLY</b>, the visuals are <b>ABSOLUTELY CRAZY</b>. definitely the last for the best. <b>wow.</b></p>
        <p>this song also has a secret, in which the face spews out objects that correlate to the original "oscilloscope music" songs. dots, lines, blocks, yada yada. shout out to the commenter that found this out. you and jerobeam are geniuses.</p>
        <p>great sendoff, great song, great visuals. <b>thank you, jerobeam <3 absolutely crazy.</b></p>
